This is a simple animation of the Fourier series graph being drawn by rotating lines in p5js. The animation demonstrates how the sum of sine and cosine functions can converge to the original function. The code is open-source and available on GitHub.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a simple animation of the Fourier series graph being drawn by a bunch of lines rotating from each other using p5js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The animation shows how the sum of sine and cosine functions can gradually converge to the original function as more terms are added to the Fourier series. The code is open-source and available on GitHub, so feel free to check it out and explore the world of creative coding and mathematical art!.
